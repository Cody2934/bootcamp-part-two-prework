# Bootcamp: Part 2
## Intermediate Software Development

To get your laptop and yourself ready for the start of Bootcamp II, there are a series of pre-work tasks to complete.

Before completing the tasks in this document, ensure that you have completed all of the installation tasks in the [Bootcamp I](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/bootcamp-one-prework).

In particular, if you have tested in to Bootcamp II and did not take Bootcamp I, be especially attentive to the git and GitHub portion of the Bootcamp I prework. Note that your future classmates who took Bootcamp I will already have a month of practice using git and GitHub; it is a common area of challenge in Bootcamp II for students who tested in to the course. 

Note that the tasks below have a corresponding assignment to submit in your Canvas course, but be aware that at the time you receive the link to this pre-work that the Canvas course may not yet be published, depending upon the timing of Admissions processes and when class begins. Typically, Canvas courses are published 5-7 days before class begins.

### Setup of Your Laptop Dev Environment (Required Canvas assignment)

This next section will walk you through setting up your local environment. There is also a related canvas assignment that you need to turn in for this. 

When you are done installing both the Heroku CLI and postgres, make sure to verify them again one directly after the other so that both of the output message are on your terminal screen at the same time. Once they are both on your screen, take a screen single screen shot and use that as your submission for your canvas assignment.
